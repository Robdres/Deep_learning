# Deep learning 
Repository to go side by side learning about machine learning with the theoretical book [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.
The idea is to create simple examples and useful code.

I am no expert but I have worked a lot in machine learning, I am not near qualified to know it all so if I am mistaken I want to know, in order to make this repository as a way of new students feel that machine learning is a step by step process.
Also english is my second language and when I am tired I often make mistakes in my writting (I also do them in spanish hehe), please make me know or do a PR, will happy add you as colaborators.
